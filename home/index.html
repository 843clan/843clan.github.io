                	<p>Have you ever played League of Legends? Been wanting to play Ranked, but have been irritated by a lot of the players who's assigned to your team, whether with insults, intentional feeding, or just not showing up at all? Look no further! There's a place that can help you out--the club The Official *843* Server. A server on the chat program Discord, *843* is a place where League of Legends players go to get into team matches, fool around in the special modes, or just simply hang out in the voice chats and have fun. The server implements a "rank" system--where you're rewarded with levels by participating in chat. At level 10, you become a Trusted member, which gives you some extra privileges, and at level 20, you become a Moderator and assist in the upkeep of the server. It's completely free and you're under no obligations to stay any longer than you want to! Wouldn't it be great playing League with some friends who didn't care what skill level you were, just as long as you kept the game fun for everyone? Join *843* and find the League of Legends experience you've been looking for! </p>
